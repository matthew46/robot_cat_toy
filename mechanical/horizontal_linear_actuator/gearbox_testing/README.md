Gearbox testing checklist:
1. Updated motor_to_gear_adaptor good, but need to reduce length by 1mm, and width by .25mm
2. motor mount holes locations and size are good, but make the inside sunken in so that a nut can be screwed on the other end while not touching the gear
    - Screw is 4mm and nut is 2mm in length, so make a 2mm or 1.5mm sunkin portion for the nut
3. Increase clearance of pinion and gear by 1mm. They are a little too tight
4. Create assembly file with the large gear and motor_to_gear_adapter so that the 2 parts are combined when 3d printed
